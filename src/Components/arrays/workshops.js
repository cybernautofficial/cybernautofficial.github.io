        content:"All the youngsters interested in developing games and gaming consoles (Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch) to the people interested in developing operating systems and browsers, C++ is the answer. It is a general-purpose programming language that is powerful. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, functional, etc. making it flexible and portable. Being an object-oriented programming language, it gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. Also, it supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance.C++ is a superset of C language. If one knows the C programming language, C++ is very easy to learn as both are similar. ",

Everyone who expects that coding should also be simple, Python programming language is the solution. Python is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax. Python is said to be “loosely typed” as this programming language doesn’t require you to state the type of value a function returns when you define the function or the type of a variable before you create it. It is used for web development, AI, ML(Machine Learning), operating systems, mobile application development, developing and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Simple video games can also be built using python. Anyone who feels they don't know where to begin in coding, start with python. ",

Figma is a tool that can be used to design user interfaces for apps and also for web pages. It is a vector graphics tool and can easily be accessed via the web. The best part is, it is available on all platforms like Windows, Linux, and Mac. Figma is an easy platform to design compared to others and can be used by a group to design. A project which one is working on can easily be shared with the other group members and we can easily see who is it was edited by last. The pen tool in Figma allows you to connect paths to closed shapes in order to construct 3D forms in the same way you would if you were drawing on paper. If designing is your interest, Figma is the right platform for you.",

There are other search engines as well like Yahoo, Bing, Ask, AOL, etc. All these search engines use data science algorithms to give the best result for what we have searched in a fraction of seconds. Data Science is a field that gives insights from structured and unstructured data, using different scientific algorithms and methods. Through data science, one knows how to use their skills in maths, statistics, and programming to organize large data sets. Data science can be used to gain knowledge about behaviors and processes, write algorithms that process large amounts of information quickly and efficiently, increase the security and privacy of sensitive data, and guide data-driven decision-making. If you possess these skills, do explore data science.",

It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. There are three types of web development one can learn, front-end, back-end, and full-stack. To learn web development, one must understand HTML AND CSS. HTML helps to create the web pages and CSS to style them. All who have basic knowledge of these two languages and are interested in creating a website should try web development.",

It sets systems to the task of searching through data to look for patterns and adjusting actions accordingly. It allows software applications to become accurate in predicting outcomes. Moreover, machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs. The primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention. There are four types of machine learning - Supervised machine learning algorithms, unsupervised machine learning algorithms, Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms, and Reinforcement machine learning algorithms. Basic knowledge in math, computer science fundamentals and programming, data modeling and evaluation, neural networks, communication skills, and natural language processing are the skillsets required to learn machine learning. ML is used in a lot of things nowadays like in image recognition, voice recognition, predictions, surveillance videos, social media platform, spam and malware, customer support, search engine, etc.",
