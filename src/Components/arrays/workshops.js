It is a general-purpose programming language that is powerful.C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc. making it flexible. If one knows the C programming language, C++ is very easy to learn as both are similar.",

Everyone who expects that coding should also be simple, python programming language is the solution. Python is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax. It is used for web development, AI, ML(Machine Learning), operating systems, and mobile application development.Simple video games can also be built using python. Anyone who feels they don't know where to begin in coding, start with python.",

Figma is a tool that can be used to design user interfaces for apps and also for web pages. It is a vector graphics tool and can easily be accessed via the web.  The best part is, it is available on all platforms like Windows, Linux, and Mac. Figma is an easy platform to design compared to others and can be used by a group to design. A project which one is working on can easily be shared with the other group members and we can easily see who is it was edited by last. If designing is your interest, Figma is the right platform for you.",

Creating a website is a long process. The work done in developing a website is called web development. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. There are three types of web development one can learn, front-end, back-end, and full-stack. To learn web development, one must understand HTML AND CSS. HTML helps to create the web pages and CSS to style them. All who have basic knowledge of these two languages and are interested in creating a website should try web development.",

It sets systems to the task of searching through data to look for patterns and adjusting actions accordingly. It allows software applications to become accurate in predicting outcomes. Moreover, machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs. The primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention. There are four types of machine learning - Supervised machine learning algorithms, unsupervised machine learning algorithms, Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms, and Reinforcement machine learning algorithms. Basic knowledge in math, computer science fundamentals and programming, data modeling and evaluation, neural networks, communication skills, and natural language processing are the skillsets required to learn machine learning. ML is used in a lot of things nowadays like in image recognition, voice recognition, predictions, surveillance videos, social media platform, spam and malware, customer support, search engine, etc.",
